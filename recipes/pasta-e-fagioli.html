        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, this is the complete copycat of Olive Garden’s heartwarming Pasta e Fagioli, which is a pasta and bean soup. And it’s seriously so easy to make right at home! All that takes some effort is the prep work for the veggies. That’s it! Best of all, this recipe is enough to feed an army! Just be sure to add the pasta to serve or else it’ll soak up all the liquid over time.
